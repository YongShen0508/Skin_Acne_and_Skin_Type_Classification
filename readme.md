‚úÖ Objective 1: Development and Comparison of Skin Analysis Models
üéØ Goal
To develop a deep learning-based skin analysis model capable of evaluating and determining users' skin conditions with high accuracy.

üß† Models Evaluated
The following models were trained and tested on a labeled dataset of facial skin images:
1. **Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
2. **EfficientNetB0**
3. **ResNet50**
4. **YOLOv8**
5. **Image Classification with ChatGPT API Integration**

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
Used preprocessed facial images labeled with acne severity levels (e.g., Level 0, 1, 2) and skin type images (dry, oily and normal)

Split data into training and testing sets.

Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

üìä Results Summary
| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| CNN              | xx%      |  xx%      | xx%    |
| EfficientNetB0   | xx%      | xx%       |xx%     |
| ResNet50         | xx%      | xx%       |xx%     |
| YOLOv8           |  xx%     | xx%       |xx%     |
| ChatGPT API      | xx%      |  xx%      | xx%    |


üèÜ Best Performing Model
YOLOv8 model achieved the highest accuracy and was selected as the core skin analysis model for future stages of the system.

‚úÖ Status
Objective 1 completed successfully. The most accurate model has been selected for use in the skin condition evaluation component.
