‚úÖ Objective 1: Development and Comparison of Skin Analysis Models
üéØ Goal
To develop a deep learning-based skin analysis model capable of evaluating and determining users' skin conditions with high accuracy.

üß† Models Evaluated
The following models were trained and tested on a labeled dataset of facial skin images:

Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

EfficientNetB0

ResNet50

YOLOv8

Image classification with ChatGPT API integration

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
Used preprocessed facial images labeled with acne severity levels (e.g., Level 0, 1, 2).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
