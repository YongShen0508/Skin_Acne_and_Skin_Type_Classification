‚úÖ Objective 1: Development and Comparison of Skin Analysis Models
üéØ Goal
To develop a deep learning-based skin analysis model capable of evaluating and determining users' skin conditions with high accuracy.

üß† Models Evaluated
The following models were trained and tested on a labeled dataset of facial skin images:
1. **Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
2. **EfficientNetB0**
3. **ResNet50**
4. **YOLOv8**
5. **Image Classification with ChatGPT API Integration**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

- Used preprocessed facial images labeled with:
  - **Acne severity levels**: Level 0, Level 1, Level 2  
  - **Skin types**: Dry, Oily, Normal  
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.  
- Applied **data augmentation techniques** to improve model generalization.  
- Evaluated model performance using the following metrics:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
