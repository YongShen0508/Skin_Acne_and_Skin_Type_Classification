## ✅ Objective 1: Development and Comparison of Skin Analysis Models

### 🎯 Goal
To develop a deep learning-based skin analysis model capable of evaluating and determining users' skin conditions with high accuracy.

### 🧠 Models Evaluated
The following models were trained and tested on a labeled dataset of facial skin images:

1. **Classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
2. **EfficientNetB0**
3. **ResNet50**
4. **YOLOv8**
5. **Image Classification with ChatGPT API Integration**

### ⚙️ Methodology

- Utilized preprocessed facial images labeled with:
  - **Acne severity levels**: Level 0, Level 1, Level 2  
  - **Skin types**: Dry, Oily, Normal  
- Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets  
- Applied **data augmentation techniques** (e.g., flipping, rotation, brightness adjustment) to improve model generalization  
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

### 📊 Results Summary

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| CNN                | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    |
| EfficientNetB0     | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    |
| ResNet50           | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    |
| YOLOv8             | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    |
| ChatGPT API        | xx%      | xx%       | xx%    |

### 🏆 Best Performing Model
The **YOLOv8** model achieved the highest accuracy among all tested models and was selected as the core skin analysis model for subsequent stages of the system.

### ✅ Status
Objective 1 has been successfully completed. The most accurate and reliable model has been selected to power the skin condition evaluation component.
